NOTE: There are some dependency issues with building the Roles, Sets and Stages for the Rehearsal Player platform
This affects steps X, XI and XIV below. Essentially, there is a circular dependency chain:

    Mle2dRole[d].dll "depends on" Mle2dSet[d].lib
    Mle2dSet[d].dll "depends on" MleIvStage[d].lib and Mle2dRole[d].lib
    Mle3dSet[d].dll "depends on" MleIvStage[d].lib
    MleIvStage[d].dll "depends on" Mle2dRole[d].lib and Mle2dSet[d].lib and Mle3dSet[d].lib

To break this dependency chain, we need to generate the .lib files independently of when the .dll files are built.
    1. Build the MleIvStage object files first. This will generate the .obj files but fail to create the
       MleIvStage[d].dll and MleIvStage[d].lib files. See step XIV below for the Microsoft workspace location.
    2. In a shell window, cd "$MLE_HOME\Parts\stages\rehearsal\src\Debug.
    3. Run "lib.exe /out:MleIvStaged.lib /def *.obj". This will generate the MleIvStaged.lib file.
       Copy the library to $MLE_HOME\lib\rehearsal.
    4. cd "$MLE_HOME\Parts\stages\rehearsal\src\Release.
    5. Run "lib.exe /out:MleIvStage.lib /def *.obj". This will generate the MleIvStage.lib file.
       Copy the library to $MLE_HOME\lib\rehearsal.
    6. Build the Mle2dRole object files. This will generate the .obj files but fail to create the
       Mle2dRole[d].dll and Mle2dRole[d].lib files. See step X below for the Microsoft workspace location.
    7. In a shell window, cd "$MLE_HOME\Parts\roles\win32\Mle2dRole\Debug.
    8. Run "lib.exe /out:Mle2dRoled.lib /def *.obj". This will generate the Mle2dRoled.lib file.
       Copy the library to $MLE_HOME\lib\rehearsal.
    9. cd "$MLE_HOME\Parts\roles\win32\Mle2dRole\Release.
    10. Run "lib.exe /out:Mle2dRole.lib /def *.obj". This will generate the Mle2dRole.lib file.
        Copy the library to $MLE_HOME\lib\rehearsal.
