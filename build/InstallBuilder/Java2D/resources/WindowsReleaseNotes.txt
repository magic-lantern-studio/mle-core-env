1.1 Introduction

Magic Lantern is a interactive, title development platform for authoring highly interactive titles, such as interactive TV applications, games, educational programs, and point-of-information/sales kiosks. It is being created specifically for the real-world needs of professional title development teams as they break new ground in the development of real-time interactive titles.

The Magic Lantern authoring system is being developed with an understanding of how the top professional development teams are currently creating titles. It is designed to streamline development and collaborative processes so that title developers can focus on enhancing content, performance and interactivity. The Magic Lantern development environment will run on Windows and UNIX workstations; for title playback, the Magic Lantern architecture facilitates efficient deployment of a title to one or more platforms, such as an interactive TV set-top box, a Pentium-based PC, or game console.

This release targets applications being developed for the Java 2D platform. It is compliant with the Oracle Java SE Version 1.8.
