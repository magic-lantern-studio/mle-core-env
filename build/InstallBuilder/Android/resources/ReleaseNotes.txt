Magic Lantern Android Studio 1.0 Release Notes
Date: April 5, 2013


This documentation provices information concerning the Alpha release of the Magic Lantern Android Studio authoring tool.


1.1 Introduction

Magic Lantern is a interactive, title development platform for authoring highly interactive titles, such as interactive TV applications, games, educational programs, and point-of-information/sales kiosks. It is being created specifically for the real-world needs of professional title development teams as they break new ground in the development of real-time interactive titles.

The Magic Lantern authoring system is being developed with an understanding of how the top professional development teams are currently creating titles. It is designed to streamline development and collaborative processes so that title developers can focus on enhancing content, performance and interactivity. The Magic Lantern development environment will run on Windows and UNIX workstations; for title playback, the Magic Lantern architecture facilitates efficient deployment of a title to one or more platforms, such as an interactive TV set-top box, a Pentium-based PC, or game console.

This release targets applications being developed for the Android platform. It is compliant with Version 2.3.3 of the Android SDK and Version R16 of the Google ADT. Future releases of the studio will include more support for the remaining Android SDK targets.


1.2 Open Source

Magic Lantern is an Open Source project that can be found on SourceForge. The project can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/wz-mle/. Downloads can be obtained for the Windows platform.

1.3 Platform Requirements

Magic Lantern has the following system requirements:

• Microsoft Windows® XP, Vista or Windows 7
• 2.4 GHz Intel Core™ Duo or higher is recommended
• 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
• a video card with OpenGL 3D acceleration
• 300 MB Free hard disk space

1.4 Installation Notes

Magic Lantern is currently distributed as a complete Eclipse development environment, as opposed to separable Eclipse features and plugins. Unlike other Eclipse-based authoring solutions, the installation does not require the user to use the "Update Site" manager to import the required functionality. However, the user will be responsible for installing the Android SDK.

The launch script, mleandroidstudio.bat, does not work for installations that specify a custom installation directory, instead of the default "C:\Program Files\WizzerWorks". The script is also broken for 64-bit versions of the Windows 7 and Vista operating systems. The workaraond is to modify the mleandroidstudio.bat script to point to the custom installation directory. For example, by default the mleandoroidstudio.bat script is set up to use

  set MLE_ROOT=C:\PROGRA~1\WizzerWorks\MagicLanternAndroidStudio
  set MLE_HOME=C:\PROGRA~1\WizzerWorks\MagicLanternAndroidStudio
  set MLE_WORKPRINTS=//C/PROGRA~1/WizzerWorks/MagicLanternAndroidStudio

These environment variables should be modified to point to the custom directory specified during installation. For example

  set MLE_ROOT=C:\Users\msm\bin\WizzerWorks\MagicLanternAndroidStudio
  set MLE_HOME=C:\Users\msm\bin\WizzerWorks\MagicLanternAndroidStudio
  set MLE_WORKPRINTS=//C/Users\msm\bin/WizzerWorks/MagicLanternAndroidStudio

For 64-bit installations, make the following changes to reference the default 32-bit installation directory.

  set MLE_ROOT=C:\PROGRA~2\WizzerWorks\MagicLanternAndroidStudio
  set MLE_HOME=C:\PROGRA~2\WizzerWorks\MagicLanternAndroidStudio
  set MLE_WORKPRINTS=//C/PROGRA~2/WizzerWorks/MagicLanternAndroidStudio

Please refer to the installation document, "Magic Lantern Android Installation", for the official instructions on installing Magic Lantern.
