# This target lists the build script that needs to be run before doing a
# CherryPick build without {clobber,p_check -w}. By default, this has a NULL
# build script for each ISM; those ISMs that need to do something special
# before a CherryPick build can define the build script for this target in
# their top level Makefile.

# Making images, cleaning the collections, or verifying the collection
