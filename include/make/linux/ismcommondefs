# ismcommondefs - Common build definitions and macros for ISMs
#                 (Note: includes commondefs!)
#
# This file contains definitions that should be common to all
# Makefiles for a particular ISM.  This file automatically includes
# 'commondefs' as well.  The ismcommondefs file adds definitions that
# require an ISM-like structure to exist (e.g. ISM_DEPTH must be
# defined for each Makefile).  Include ismcommondefs either in your
# top level ismdefs file or individually in each Makefile.
#
# Note: to use this file, the following variables MUST be
# defined before this file is (eventually) included:
#
#	PLATFORM
#	MLE_ROOT
#	ISM_DEPTH
#	ISM_NAME
#	ISM_VERSION
#	ISM_TIMEBOMB_DATE
#
# The build uses GNU make and a Bourne-compatible shell. All pathnames and
# directories should be specified in UNIX style using the '/' separator
# (drive letters can also be used).
#
# To build software on Linux you must install Magic Lantern.
# Assuming the toolroot is installed in the default location
# /usr/local/WizzerWorks/MagicLantern, you must put
# /usr/local/WizzerWorks/MagicLantern/InstallBuilder/bin in your PATH
#
# The standard pathname for this file is:
#
#	/usr/local/WizzerWorks/MagicLantern/include/make/linux/ismcommondefs
#
# If Magic Lantern has been installed in a location other than
# /usr/local/WizzerWorks/MagicLantern, define the environment variable
# MLE_ROOT with the new location.
